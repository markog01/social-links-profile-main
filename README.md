## My process

- ### Plan and code.
  I started the project by creating its HTML structure. This part, I can say, is the least time-consuming compared to the other parts of the process.

- ### Style the components.
  After the HTML, I proceeded to CSS, where fonts, sizes, colors, spacings, and other properties were involved. Most of the time was spent on this part because the design involves a lot of styling in order to achieve the expected look. I style it a lot but it was hard without having design in Figma to have exact padding, margin etc. But at the end I think it looks very similar to the exact design.
- ### Test and try it for several times.
  I made design and markup very fast, but I spend a lot of time to look exact the same and responsive design to be good on every device.




### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive ( media query)
- VS code studio software



### What I learned


In this lesson, I only reviewed the material; I didn't learn or use any new techniques. However, this project was helpful for me to refresh everything I already knew so that I wouldn't forget these things.

### Continued development
These are the things that I want to work on in future projects:

- Mobile-first responsive design
- Flex and grid
- Cool hover effects and animations
